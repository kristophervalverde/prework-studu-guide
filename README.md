# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this webpage is to maken it easier to find my all of me prework notes, as they are all now in a singular location.
I built this project to cut down on the time it takes to access all the different places I keep I store separate prework notes.
The problem that this study guide solves is it take it takes a grat chunk of time to go to all the sourses for your notes, and consolidates all of them into one file.
Throghout this project I have learned the basics of coding such as the command line in GitBash, how to merge files in GitHub, and how to us VS code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
