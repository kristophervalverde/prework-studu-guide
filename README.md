# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this webpage is to maken it easier to find my all of me prework notes, as they are all now in a singular location.
I built this project to cut down on the time it takes to access all the different places I keep I store separate prework notes.
The problem that this study guide solves is it take it takes a grat chunk of time to go to all the sourses for your notes, and consolidates all of them into one file.
Throghout this project I have learned the basics of coding such as the command line in GitBash, how to merge files in GitHub, and how to us VS code.
